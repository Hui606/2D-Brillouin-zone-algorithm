# 2D-Brillouin-zone-algorithm
To compute and draw 2D Brillouin zones in several seconds

To run the algorithm,

1. Input parameters required in input.py
    * Direction: it is the direction that the program follows to increase the number of unit cells
    * Points: they are the points in the unit cell
    * Range: it determines the number of unit cells in the result of the algorithm
    * Start & Stop:  users use them to extract the zones they want to observe

2. Run tracking_layer.py in terminals
